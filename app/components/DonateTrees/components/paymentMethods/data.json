    "description": "Plant-for-the-Planet plants one tree every 15 seconds. When the children and youth initiative first took over the area, it was a sad sight: an ‘investor’ had felled all the trees and the land lay barren. Within only one year, Plant-for-the-Planet succeeded in making the area a vital carbon sink once again. Today, 78 workers are planting, on average, 5,500 seedlings per day. They are placing and caring for eight different native tree species and achieve a 94 percent survival rate, which is more than four times higher than other restoration projects in the region (around 20 percent ).  Approximately 1100 trees grow per hectare. It's possible for Plant-for-the-Planet to plant and care for one tree for one Euro. By the end of 2020, Plant-for-the-Planet will have planted ten million trees in Campeche. See more: plant-for-the-planet.org/en/about-us/planting-location-campeche\"\n",
